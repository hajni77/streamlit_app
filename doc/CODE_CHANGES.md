## Modified Files

### 1. algorithms/beam_search.py

#### Changes:
- Added timing tracking for layout generation process
- Implemented object placement timing for final beam layouts only
- Added beam position information to timing logs
- Restructured code to improve timing accuracy
- Fixed indentation and syntax issues

#### Key code additions:
```python
with TimingContext("layout_generation", layout_id=layout_id, room_size=room_size, num_objects=num_objects) as tc:
    # Layout generation code...
    tc.add_info({"beam_width": self.beam_width})
```

```python
# Only log timing for objects that made it into the final beam
for idx, selected_layout in enumerate(beam):
    # Get the objects in this layout
    placed_objects = selected_layout.bathroom.get_placed_objects()
    
    # Find the most recently placed object (should be the current one)
    for placed_obj in placed_objects:
        if placed_obj["object"].object_type == obj:
            # Log timing info for this successful placement
            with TimingContext("object_placement", layout_id=layout_id, room_size=room_size, num_objects=1) as tc_obj:
                tc_obj.add_info({
                    "object_type": obj,
                    "position": placed_obj["position"][:2],
                    "score": selected_layout.score,
                    "beam_position": idx + 1  # Position in the beam (1-10)
                })
            break  # Only log once per layout
```

### 2. optimization/scoring.py

#### Changes:
- Added timing tracking for layout scoring process
- Improved error handling for timing operations
- Added metadata logging for scoring context

#### Key code additions:
```python
with TimingContext("layout_scoring", layout_id=layout_id, room_size=room_size, num_objects=num_objects) as tc:
    self.total_score, self.score_breakdown = self.score(layout)
    tc.add_info({"total_score": self.total_score})
```

### 3. app.py

#### Changes:
- Added new "Performance" tab to the Streamlit interface
- Implemented interactive visualization components
- Added filtering and data analysis capabilities
- Fixed indentation issues and syntax errors

#### Key code additions:
```python
with tab6:
    st.markdown("<h2 class='section-header'>Performance Analysis</h2>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
    # ... visualization code ...
```

## Technical Details

### TimingContext Implementation

The core of the timing system is the `TimingContext` class, which uses Python's context manager protocol:

```python
class TimingContext:
    """Context manager for timing code blocks and logging results."""
    
    def __init__(self, operation, layout_id="", room_size=None, num_objects=0):
        self.operation = operation
        self.layout_id = layout_id
        self.room_size = room_size
        self.num_objects = num_objects
        self.additional_info = {}
        self.start_time = 0
        
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self
        
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        end_time = time.time()
        duration_sec = (end_time - self.start_time)
        duration_ms = duration_sec * 1000  # Convert to milliseconds
        
        # ... logging code ...
```

### Duration Calculation Fix

The duration calculation was fixed to properly convert from seconds to milliseconds:

```python
duration_sec = (end_time - self.start_time)
duration_ms = duration_sec * 1000  # Convert seconds to milliseconds

# Ensure no zero durations
if duration_ms < 0.01:
    duration_ms = 0.01
```

### Logging Format Improvements

The logging format was improved to increase precision:

```python
log_message = f"{timestamp} | {operation} | {duration_ms:.4f}ms | Layout: {layout_id}"
```

```python
"duration_ms": f"{duration_ms:.4f}",
```

### Selective Timing for Object Placement

Object placement timing was modified to only track objects that make it into the final beam:

```python
# Only log timing for objects that made it into the final beam
for idx, selected_layout in enumerate(beam):
    # ... code to find objects and log timing ...
```

This significantly reduces the amount of timing data collected while focusing on the most relevant information.

## Performance Recommendations

The system now provides automatic performance recommendations based on timing data analysis:

```python
def get_performance_recommendations(df: pd.DataFrame = None) -> List[str]:
    """Analyze timing data and provide recommendations for improvements."""
    # ... analysis code ...
    return recommendations
```

These recommendations help identify areas where the layout generator can be optimized for better performance.
