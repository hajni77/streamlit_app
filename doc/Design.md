Based on my analysis of your code, I understand the logic you're using to design bathroom layouts. Your approach follows a sophisticated rule-based system with several key components:

Your Bathroom Layout Design Logic
Prioritized Object Placement:
You sort objects by size (largest first) to ensure the most important fixtures get placed first, then choose based on prioroty
You have special handling for sinks (regular vs. double) based on bathroom size
For small bathrooms (<300x300cm), you always use a regular sink
For larger bathrooms, you randomly choose between regular and double sinks
Constraint-Based Placement:
Objects have specific placement requirements:
Some must be placed in corners
Some must be against walls
Each object has "shadow space" requirements (clearance needed)
Objects have size ranges (min/max dimensions)
Randomly select a place with optimal size and place it, if fit done, if not placed (100 times) go with another object size
Accessibility Validation:
You implement pathway accessibility checking using an A* algorithm
Layouts with accessibility scores below 4 are rejected
You ensure there's enough clearance between objects (minimum 60cm pathways)
Optimization Techniques:
You optimize object placement to maximize space utilization, move object closer to each other
You maximize object sizes when possible within constraints, 5cm each time
You have special handling for cabinet placement against walls, at the end
You check for enclosed spaces that can't be reached, if enclosed a place in the corner, not good room layout
Layout Evaluation:
You score layouts based on multiple criteria
You compare multiple layouts to select the best one
You analyze pathway accessibility and provide visualization

Key Benefits of This Approach:
Exploration of Multiple Options: Instead of committing to the first valid placement, you explore multiple options for each object.
Size Optimization: By trying different sizes within the allowed range, you can find better fits.
Global Optimization: By maintaining multiple candidate layouts, you're less likely to get stuck in local optima.
Progressive Refinement: The beam search approach allows you to maintain promising partial layouts and extend them.
Flexible Scoring: You can adjust the scoring function to prioritize different aspects of the layout.
Implementation Considerations:
Performance: This approach will be more computationally intensive than your current method. You might need to limit the number of placement options you explore.
Scoring Function: The scoring function for partial layouts is crucial. It should evaluate both the quality of current placements and the potential for future placements.
Diversity: To avoid all layouts in your beam being similar, you might want to add diversity mechanisms.
Would you like me to help you implement this approach in your existing codebase? I can provide more detailed code or focus on specific parts of the implementation.
