Based on my analysis of your code, I understand the logic you're using to design bathroom layouts. Your approach follows a sophisticated rule-based system with several key components:

Your Bathroom Layout Design Logic
Prioritized Object Placement:
You sort objects by size (largest first) to ensure the most important fixtures get placed first
You have special handling for sinks (regular vs. double) based on bathroom size
For small bathrooms (<300x300cm), you always use a regular sink
For larger bathrooms, you randomly choose between regular and double sinks
Constraint-Based Placement:
Objects have specific placement requirements:
Some must be placed in corners
Some must be against walls
Each object has "shadow space" requirements (clearance needed)
Objects have size ranges (min/max dimensions)
Accessibility Validation:
You implement pathway accessibility checking using an A* algorithm
Layouts with accessibility scores below 4 are rejected
You ensure there's enough clearance between objects (minimum 60cm pathways)
Optimization Techniques:
You optimize object placement to maximize space utilization
You maximize object sizes when possible within constraints
You have special handling for cabinet placement against walls
You check for enclosed spaces that can't be reached
Layout Evaluation:
You score layouts based on multiple criteria
You compare multiple layouts to select the best one
You analyze pathway accessibility and provide visualization
